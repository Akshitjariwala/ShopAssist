I didnt drop it or get it wet, but even with new batteries right out of the package it wont stay on anymore. Made it 7 whole months! Well done Microsoft, you use terrible suppliers and cheap materials to bring $65 controllers that cant last a year. The original Xbox controllers from 20 years ago still work, but you cant get an Xbox one controller to last a handful of games. I live a busy life and dont even play all the time so it didnt even get a ton of hours. Shame.",true

Had this thing for like 2 and a half years, still chugging along just fine.I use this for my PC, and since I don't want to deal with batteries, it's been connected via a micro USB cable since the day I got it. While the cable has gone out and had to be replaced once (despite heavy, near-daily usage), the controller itself still functions well, with no noticeable stick drift. MHW, Halo, Dark Souls, or Bloodstained, I've played a pretty wide range of games with these and have had neither compatibility issues or... well, issues, really. And to reiterate, I use mine pretty much daily.I dunno, maybe I'm lucky, but Xbox controllers in general have worked pretty well and lasted me a looooooong time.Then again, I don't ever chuck my controllers either.",true

Don't buy this for PC use.","I bought this controller new in August of 2020. Since then, the controller has chewed through five USB cables. At first, I thought they were just low quality cables I was buying, but then I shelled out $20 for an Xbox Official usb charging cable. That was exactly one month ago. The final straw was when I bought a new cable last night and it chewed through the cable in /2 hours/. The official cable is now also broken and won't connect the controller to my PC. I've heard of others with similar issues with this controller. The USB port on the controller is obviously faulty due to a design error that Microsoft has known about since 2014. I wish I had done my research. It might be okay if you only occasionally use the port to charge your controller and then connect wirelessly, but will quickly destroy itself if you try to use it as a hard wired controller because the weight of the wire will bend the connection cables. It's a massive point of failure in the device and it's not built to last. I found a nice third-party controller that has a permanently affixed USB cable. If you're looking for a controller to connect to your PC, I'd strongly suggest finding something with an undetachable USB cable unless you like throwing down $60 on a new controller every five months. I can't believe Microsoft has known about this problem for six years and continues to mass produce this garbage (while also refusing to make a permanently attached wired version) - my only conclusion is that they have designed this to fail to create a money pit for your gaming habit. Shame on you, Microsoft.",false
